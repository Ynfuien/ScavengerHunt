#### Quick info:
# 1. If you don't want a message to be sent, just set it empty - ''

# 2. You can use MiniMessage formatting for custom colors and formats!
# If you don't know how, then here is documentation:
# https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html

# 3. PlaceholderAPI is supported

# 4. Plugin placeholders are within curly brackets - {placeholder}
# And can have additional flags:
# ! - no formatting
# @ - no papi
# # - escaped double quotes (")
# To use a flag for placeholder, append it before the name - {!placeholder}
# You can also combine flags, so for example {@#placeholder}, will not parse PAPI placeholders,
# and will escape double quotes (" will become \").
# ! - is useful for player input, that is not supposed to be formatted
# @ - for input that's supposed to be formatted, but not with papi
# # - for things that can contain double quotes, and you want them in hover/click event


# Prefix that will be used for {prefix} placeholder
prefix: '<gold>[<yellow><bold>ScavengerHunt</bold><gold>]<reset>'
